## Top Pain Points (Ranked by Frequency)

### Doctor Dismissal — Women are dismissed by GPs and OBGYNs based on age, told they are 'too young' for perimenopause without any symptom assessment
**Intensity:** extreme | **Frequency:** 10/10 | **Segments:** early_stage, gp_frustrated, hrt_considering
**Coverage:** Gap → GP Export

Verbatim quotes:
> "She said 'no, not at your age, must be your thyroid.' So she ordered a TSH and T4Free test and guess what — results are in the totally normal range, as I suspected. But she didn't even ASK me what I was experiencing"
> "I've been begging for my hormones checking for the entire 5 years with no help as I'm 'too young'"
> "I suffered severe depression those 5 years, hair loss, bad acne, heavy periods, insomnia"
> "I'm 39. It all started 5 years ago this month... I nearly lost everything. My sanity, my job, my family"
> "knew i started peri at 34, but doctor disagreed: 'you're too young! take these antidepressants and xanax!' 15 years of..."

### Symptom Confusion — Brain fog is so severe it threatens women's careers, professional identities, and sense of self — and is often not recognised as a perimenopause symptom
**Intensity:** extreme | **Frequency:** 10/10 | **Segments:** established, early_stage, universal
**Coverage:** Directly Addressed → Symptom Selection

Verbatim quotes:
> "I am mortified and scared at how I see appointment times and even though I put many reminders, I can totally forget it because in my head I am convinced it's for a completely different time"
> "Brain fog is too cutesy a term for it IMO, that shit is straight up cognitive impairment"
> "It became a major issue for me at work. I was repeatedly making stupid mistakes, asking the same questions over and over"
> "I couldn't think at all. Working harder or trying to find alternative way to be able to work was also impossible since you need to think to do it"
> "I'm on HRT and still having brain fog. I'm just tired of playing medical detective"

### Symptom Severity and Life Impact — The severity of perimenopause symptoms — particularly fatigue and anxiety — is far greater than women (or their doctors) expect. Symptoms are not minor inconveniences but life-disrupting experiences that affect their ability to work, parent, maintain relationships, and enjoy their lives. The gap between how they feel and how they are expected to function is a source of profound distress.

> "I feel like I'm wasting my life feeling meh"
> "I'm in tears from being sooooo insanely fatigued. Last week I skipped the grocery store 2 days in a row, because the thought of going sounded so exhausting, I couldn't cope & I cried instead. I'm a tough girl & this crap is breaking me down hard... crushes my spirit"

> "I'm 38 and my doctor won't believe me either."
> "my family doctor blew me off and never believed me"

> "I'm done being gaslit about this. I'm done being made to feel like my pain isn't real."

### Symptom Confusion — Women experience a wide, confusing spread of symptoms — physical, cognitive, emotional — and cannot tell what is perimenopause versus something else, making it impossible to describe coherently to a doctor
**Intensity:** extreme | **Frequency:** 10/10 | **Segments:** early_stage, established, universal
**Coverage:** Directly Addressed → Symptom Selection

Verbatim quotes:
> "Drenching night sweats, increased anxiety and severe panic attacks... cystic acne... body odor has changed... insomnia... I go from depression to happiness to anger all within a day...

> "Is it midlife crisis? But I am only 40!"
> "I feel like I've amounted to a big blob of uselessness."

### Doctor Dismissal — Women's symptoms are dismissed by GPs as anxiety, depression, or 'normal for their age', preventing them from getting a perimenopause diagnosis or HRT

### Symptom Confusion — Women experience a wide, unexpected range of symptoms and have no idea they are connected to perimenopause, leading to years of worry, misdiagnosis, and unnecessary tests
**Intensity:** extreme | **Frequency:** 10/10 | **Segments:** early_stage, established, universal
**Coverage:** Gap → Symptom Selection

Verbatim quotes:
> "I didn't even know phantom smells were a thing."
> "I had no idea it could start that early, so didn't get on any HRT until 40."
> "I knew only about the menopause and not the lead up to that until I read a post where someone mentioned it."
> "At first it'll be extremely hard to handle and you'll wonder wtf is going on with you."
> "Night sweats in late 30s early 40s (female doctor my age said that's a sign of 'a very serious disease' which of course I googled - pancreatic cancer ffs - thought i was dying because I was way too young for menopause)."

### Doctor Dismissal — Women in their late 30s and early 40s are told they are 'too young' for perimenopause by GPs and OBGYNs, despite experiencing clear symptoms, leading to delayed diagnosis and mismanagement
**Intensity:** extreme | **Frequency:** 10/10 | **Segments:** early_stage, gp_frustrated
**Coverage:** Gap → GP Export

Verbatim quotes:
> "my doctor said I am too [young]"
> "You're too young to experience peri. I feel so defeated."

> "Doctors don't know crap from what I've found."

### Doctor Dismissal — Doctors attribute perimenopause symptoms to anxiety, depression, thyroid issues, or lifestyle rather than hormonal changes — and prescribe antidepressants instead
**Intensity:** extreme | **Frequency:** 9/10 | **Segments:** early_stage, established, gp_frustrated, hrt_considering
**Coverage:** Gap → GP Export

Verbatim quotes:
> "you're too young! take these antidepressants and xanax!"

> "I went to the gyn to try to talk about peri, and was dismissed. She said I need more protein and that should help"
> "I literally had to go off on my doctors before they wouldn't even try anything besides antidepressants"

### Pattern Blindness — Women cannot see patterns in their symptoms without systematic tracking — they struggle to connect symptoms to cycle, lifestyle, or hormonal changes
**Intensity:** high | **Frequency:** 9/10 | **Segments:** early_stage, established, universal
**Coverage:** Directly Addressed → Pattern Recognition

Verbatim quotes:
> "I also started tracking the symptoms with the day of my cycle and started seeing the pattern. The combination of the cycle pattern and negative test is what convinced me it was peri"
> "I have over 10-15 symptoms that come throughout the month almost in a similar pattern"
> "I started tracking it in a spreadsheet (because that's how I track my whole life lol) and the number of days in between was all over the place"
> "I've tracked and recorded for years so at least I have something to bring"
> "Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up"

### Symptom Confusion — Women don't recognise their wide range of simultaneous symptoms as perimenopause — they feel overwhelmed, scared, and confused about what is normal vs. serious
**Intensity:** high | **Frequency:** 9/10 | **Segments:** early_stage, established, universal
**Coverage:** Directly Addressed → Symptom Selection

Verbatim quotes:
> "I have vision changes, tingling in my hands and feet, issues sleeping, extreme rage"
> "There are 40 odd symptoms. So they come and go. They come and go with your cycle"
> "I didn't know it was peri for almost a year. I went to the doctor and ER complaining about my more concerning symptoms and they ran tests or sent me to specialists"
> "I did see almost every specialist under the sun. I have been to cardiologist, neurologist, and gastros"
> "Wow, no one tells you any of this, do they? No! It's all about starting your period, then childbirth. There's nothing about what happens after age 40!"

### Symptom Confusion — Women cannot tell whether their symptoms — fatigue, anxiety, brain fog — are perimenopause, something else (thyroid, long COVID, iron deficiency), or 'just life'. This ambiguity leaves them stuck, unable to advocate for themselves or make sense of what is happening to their bodies.
**Intensity:** high | **Frequency:** 9/10 | **Segments:** early_stage, universal
**Coverage:** Directly Addressed → Timeline View, Weekly Snapshot

Verbatim quotes:
> "Is this a peri thing?"
> "So tired all the time. Is this perimenopause or just life?"
> "I showed up completely unannounced in this group today, searched perimenopause because I'm 43 and going through a 'is it long Covid or perimenopause'"
> "I feel like I'm getting dementia"
> "What's high or low or whatever?"

### Pattern Blindness — Women experience symptoms that are inconsistent, unpredictable, and seemingly random — fatigue hits on days they slept well and ate well, anxiety arrives out of nowhere, crashing exhaustion precedes periods by an unknown margin. Without a record, they cannot see patterns or connect symptoms to hormonal cycles, lifestyle triggers, or treatment changes.
**Intensity:** high | **Frequency:** 9/10 | **Segments:** universal
**Coverage:** Directly Addressed → Weekly Snapshot, Pattern Recognition, Timeline View

Verbatim quotes:
> "Slept well, eaten well (heaps of protein), rested adequately, not pre-menstrual yet the fatigue that's hit all day today is so draining"
> "Sleep can be a moving target but I've been sleeping great this month and it still happened"
> "It comes in waves where some days to weeks are worse than my 'normal' tired"
> "Today I can tell I'm off because I have this weird 'looking over my shoulder' anxiety"
> "Yes — yesterday I was feeling very overwhelmed and anxious… But the weird part was…there was nothing to be overwhelmed and anxious ABOUT"

### Symptom Multiplicity and Overwhelm — Women are not dealing with one symptom but many at once — fatigue, anxiety, brain fog, heart palpitations, insomnia, muscle weakness, mood swings. The sheer number and variety of symptoms arriving simultaneously makes the experience overwhelming and impossible to track mentally.
**Intensity:** high | **Frequency:** 9/10 | **Segments:** established, universal
**Coverage:** Directly Addressed → Symptom Selection, Daily Check-In, Timeline View

Verbatim quotes:
> "Bouts of fatigue so bad my license was just..."
> "I have brain fog. Lack of focus and concentration. Bouts of fatigue"
> "Insane fatigue, muscle weakness, low stamina, brain fog"
> "The emotions, the heat waves, cravings, weight fluctuation, zero motivation and sleep? What sleep, but I am so tired ALL."
> "Heart palpitations, uncontrollable shaking"

### Doctor Dismissal — Women are dismissed by GPs who say their bloodwork is 'normal', tell them they're 'too young' for perimenopause, or redirect them to anxiety/depression diagnoses instead of investigating hormonal causes
**Intensity:** extreme | **Frequency:** 9/10 | **Segments:** early_stage, gp_frustrated, hrt_considering
**Coverage:** Gap → GP Export

Verbatim quotes:
> "my bloodwork always comes back 'normal.' The only solution suggested was going back on birth control"
> "my doctor brushed it off and said I should get evaluated for an anxiety disorder"
> "When I tried to talk to my dr. about my anxiety and wondered if it could be related to perimenopause she dismissed me and said I was too young to be in menopause"
> "My doctors wouldn't acknowledge perimenopause as a possible explanation for my hot flashes and night sweats and mood changes for the past several years"
> "it's not officially peri because my labs were 'normal' on the day I was tested"

### Symptom Confusion — Women do not recognise that their anxiety, rage, insomnia, and mood changes are perimenopause symptoms — they attribute them to mental illness, life stress, or personality change, leading to misdiagnosis and delays in appropriate treatment
**Intensity:** high | **Frequency:** 9/10 | **Segments:** early_stage, established, universal
**Coverage:** Opportunity

Verbatim quotes:
> "I didn't understand the concept of anxiety until I was 3 yrs into peri. I've always been an extrovert"
> "Since I didn't know I was in perimenopause, I just thought I was becoming a recluse"
> "I've never felt like this before and it's impacting my career and relationships"
> "I used to be fun and happy. Now I'm just an anxious depressed mess with anger problems. I thought it was because I..."
> "Why does no one warn you about the rage?"

### Anxiety Misattribution — Women with pre-existing anxiety or depression find that perimenopause dramatically intensifies these conditions, but doctors treat the mental health presentation rather than the hormonal root cause — leaving them on antidepressants instead of getting hormonal support
**Intensity:** extreme | **Frequency:** 9/10 | **Segments:** early_stage, established, gp_frustrated
**Coverage:** Gap → GP Export

Verbatim quotes:
> "peri menopause takes whatever issues we have been able to control and intensify them 1000%"
> "Peri made my anxiety exponentially worse"
> "Yes, they just want to stick you on antidepressants. Totally squashes whatever libido you have left"
> "My anxiety has been nuts and doctors do not give a shit"
> "I am questioning whether it's hormone-related or mental"

### The Fog Has a Pattern
**Target segment:** established | **Target emotion:** Fear softened by understanding

Supporting quotes:
> "I'm on HRT and still having brain fog. I'm just tired of playing medical detective"

### This Is Not Anxiety. This Is Hormones.

### You Used to Be Fine
**Target segment:** established | **Target emotion:** grief and determination

**App solution:** Sulu gives you a clear, honest record of how you've been — not a wellness journal, not a mood tracker, just a timeline you can hand your GP and say: this is what my last month looked like.

Supporting quotes:
> "Prior to about age 41, I used to weight train in the gym and do yoga every day, I was so strong"
> "I'm in tears from being sooooo insanely fatigued. Last week I skipped the grocery store 2 days in a row, because the thought of going sounded so exhausting, I couldn't cope & I cried instead. I'm a tough girl & this crap is breaking me down hard"

> "she dismissed me and said I was too young to be in menopause"
> "I recently had my annual GYN appointment & she told me to log my moods to see if they have a correlation with my cycle. I told her this is more than PMS"

### The Pattern Angle
**Target segment:** established | **Target emotion:** relief
**Hook:** "You're not imagining it. You're just missing the pattern."
**App solution:** Sulu's Timeline View and Weekly Snapshot show you how your symptoms move together over 7, 14, or 30 days — so you can finally see what's actually happening instead of just surviving it.

Supporting quotes:
> "I have good and bad days. And never know if it's because of hormones or other things"
> "I'll feel fine for chunks of the day, then dreadful and frustrated for an hour or so"
> "a storm of symptoms—hot flashes, intense anxiety, insomnia"

### The Identity Angle
**Target segment:** universal | **Target emotion:** grief and hope
**Hook:** "You used to be funny. Calm. Yourself. That person hasn't gone anywhere — you just need to understand what's changed."
**App solution:** Sulu helps you see that what feels like personality change has a pattern — and patterns have reasons. Track what changes, and walk into your next appointment knowing exactly what to say.

Supporting quotes:

> "I hate what I become after my 40s"
> "previously I'd never in my life been an anxious person, needed any meds etc"

### The Rage Angle
**Target segment:** early_stage | **Target emotion:** shock recognition
**Hook:** "Nobody warned you about the rage. You're not broken — but you do need a record of it."
**App solution:** Sulu lets you track mood, irritability, and anxiety alongside your other symptoms so you can see when it spikes, what precedes it, and bring something concrete to your GP instead of just saying 'I feel angry all the time.'

Supporting quotes:
> "Why does no one warn you about the rage?"
> "I got warned about hot flashes and weight gain. Never heard any one around me speak about the rage. A little heads up would have been nice"
> "I am so impatient and completely reactive. I feel I have zero tolerance for bs"

### The HRT Tracking Angle
**Target segment:** hrt_considering | **Target emotion:** frustration and hope
**Hook:** "Started HRT and still not sure if it's working? You need more than a feeling — you need a record."
**App solution:** Sulu's Change Markers let you log HRT starts and dose changes alongside daily symptoms, so over time you can see what's actually shifted — and have a real conversation with your doctor about what to adjust.

Supporting quotes:
> "I felt an improvement in my mood initially but over the last month or so I have gone back to feeling the same before I started"
> "overall mood, irritability and anxiety are better, but like you, I am experiencing inconsistencies"

### The 30-Second Angle

**App solution:** Sulu's Daily Check-In uses simple 0–3 sliders for up to 7 perimenopause-specific symptoms. Nothing to overthink. After 14 days, your GP Export is ready — a clear PDF that does the explaining for you.

Supporting quotes:
> "I don't know where to start"
> "I'm honestly at a breaking point"
> "I feel so doomed some days"

### The Evidence You Didn't Have
**Target segment:** gp_frustrated | **Target emotion:** Vindication and empowerment
**Hook:** "You know something is wrong. The problem is proving it in a 10-minute appointment."
**App solution:** The GP Export generates a clean, dated symptom timeline in 30 seconds — something concrete to put in front of your doctor instead of trying to explain months of lived experience from memory.

Supporting quotes:
> "I hated the feeling of powerlessness in that room."
> "I came to it prepared to either be heard or to be minimized."
> "I info dumped all over the medical assistant who roomed me so I assumed that info got relayed (which it probably didn't)"

### You're Not Going Crazy
**Target segment:** early_stage | **Target emotion:** Relief and validation
**Hook:** "When it started, you weren't sure what you were feeling. You're still not sure. That uncertainty has a name."
**App solution:** Sulu's symptom list was built specifically for perimenopause — not periods, not general wellness. Logging what's actually happening, day by day, is the first step to seeing it clearly.

Supporting quotes:
> "I thought I was going crazy."
> "OMG I want to cry from relief!! I thought something was off with me"
> "I've had to live with them for months before I figured out it wasn't just the house heat kicking into overdrive."

### Finally, a Timeline
**Target segment:** established | **Target emotion:** Control and clarity
**Hook:** "You've been living with this for years. It's time to stop explaining from memory and start showing the pattern."
**App solution:** The Timeline View and Weekly Snapshot show you exactly how your symptoms have moved — week on week, over 30 days — so you can see what's getting better, what's getting worse, and what's correlated with what.

Supporting quotes:
> "So it took a long time to piece the insomnia together with other symptoms as possible/probable perimenopause."
> "Within a 6 month period I had major changes to my skin, hair, eyes, weight, sudden joint pain, trouble staying asleep, brain fog, etc."
> "I did all my tracking and research alone."

### Walk In With Something
**Target segment:** hrt_considering | **Target emotion:** Confidence and readiness
**Hook:** "If you're going to ask for HRT, you need more than a feeling. You need a record."
**App solution:** After 14 days of tracking, Sulu generates a GP Export — a clear PDF summary of your symptoms, patterns and any medication changes. Something calm and legible to put in front of a doctor who needs convincing.

Supporting quotes:
> "I'm so angry and I can't stop thinking about it so now I'm going to wait for a referral for an appointment that is going to happen months from now for someone else to not allow me the CHANCE to try HRT"
> "I point blank ask for it and he says NO."
> "They never can provide it. So they're just operating on 'what they've heard'"

### 30 Seconds. Not a Wellness Routine.
**Target segment:** tracker_fatigued | **Target emotion:** Relief from overwhelm
**Hook:** "You don't need another app that wants your food diary, your sleep score, and your mood in fifteen steps."
**App solution:** Sulu is a daily check-in. Three to seven symptoms, simple 0-3 sliders, done in 30 seconds. No habit stacks, no gamification, no noise — just your own data, building into a picture you can actually use.

Supporting quotes:
> "I can't even tell what's new, what's perimenopause, and what's actual menopause."
> "I did all my tracking and research alone."
> "Spend a ton of money. In the beginning some things got better but lately everything is just getting worse."

### Subtle Symptoms Are Still Symptoms
**Target segment:** early_stage | **Target emotion:** Recognition and relief
**Hook:** "It doesn't have to be dramatic to count. Mild, intermittent, and easy to explain away — that's how it often starts."
**App solution:** Sulu's symptom tracking captures the full range — not just dramatic hot flashes, but the clammy wake-ups, the low-level anxiety, the brain fog that comes and goes. Small entries, over time, build a picture that's hard to ignore.

Supporting quotes:
> "I was asked if I had hot flashes and I said no. I thought that meant you are soaked in sweat."
> "I wake up clammy and didn't realize that was night sweats because I wasn't drenched in sweat."
> "I just thought I'd put this out there in case anyone else was failing to notice the more subtle symptoms of peri"

### The Evidence Angle — Walk in with proof, not pleading
**Target segment:** gp_frustrated | **Target emotion:** Frustration and determination
**Hook:** "You've already tried explaining it. Now you can show it."
**App solution:** After 14 days of daily check-ins, the GP Export generates a clear PDF timeline of your symptoms — something concrete to hand over at your next appointment instead of trying to remember everything in the moment.

Supporting quotes:
> "Literally every doctor and specialist I've seen where I've said I'm going through perimenopause has said 'really? 44 is young for that'"
> "It took me months to convince her and that day I was radiating so much heat she was like oh???"
> "Write down every little symptom time and date! Keep track of it"

### The Pattern Angle — Months of fog, 30 seconds of clarity
**Target segment:** early_stage | **Target emotion:** Relief and recognition
**Hook:** "Something has been off for a while. You just haven't been able to prove it yet."
**App solution:** Sulu's Timeline View shows your symptoms mapped across 7, 14, and 30 days — so you can see what's been building before your next appointment.

Supporting quotes:
> "I think it's more when you realize something is REALLY off, and look back and see all the small things leading up to it"
> "In hindsight, my PMDD diagnosis in 2016 was likely the onset for perimenopause"
> "Regardless of how many dr appointments I shared concerns about assorted symptoms for the past two decades, no medical professional ever made any connection"

### The Anti-Overwhelm Angle — Track without dreading it
**Target segment:** tracker_fatigued | **Target emotion:** Relief
**Hook:** "Not another app that wants everything from you."
**App solution:** Sulu takes 30 seconds a day. Three simple sliders, the symptoms that matter to you, nothing else. No streaks, no dashboards, no noise.

Supporting quotes:

> "I simply have no passion or interest in anything I used to, I'm so tired all of the time"
> "it's all just too much"

### The Validation Angle — It's not all in your head
**Target segment:** gp_frustrated | **Target emotion:** Anger and vindication
**Hook:** "Your doctor called it anxiety. Your body has been keeping receipts."
**App solution:** Sulu builds a clear, dated record of what you've been experiencing — so when you go back, you're not relying on memory. You have a timeline.

Supporting quotes:
> "She said I'm too young (I'm 38) and it's 'just anxiety'. I'm literally having every symptom!"
> "We are put on an SSRI because these physical problems must be a manifestation of anxiety and depression"
> "I feel like I'm going crazy"

### The HRT Readiness Angle — Give your doctor something to work with
**Target segment:** hrt_considering | **Target emotion:** Hope and agency
**Hook:** "Before they can help you, they need to see the full picture."
**App solution:** Sulu's GP Export gives a healthcare provider a clear, timestamped summary of your symptoms over weeks — exactly the kind of consistent evidence that supports an HRT conversation.

Supporting quotes:
> "If symptoms are consistent over time, despite what hormonal blood work states... you could be a good candidate for MHT/HRT"
> "My OBGYN put me on HRT based on my symptoms. She started low and watched how I responded"
> "I don't know if I should be treating the anxiety with an SSRI or if I should be looking into HRT"

### The Early Stage Angle — You're not imagining it and you're not too young
**Target segment:** early_stage | **Target emotion:** Fear and self-doubt turning to clarity
**Hook:** "38 is not too young. And your list of symptoms is not nothing."
**App solution:** Sulu helps you track what's changing before you can even name it — so by the time you go to your GP, you're not guessing. You have weeks of your own data.

Supporting quotes:
> "Feel free to tell me I'm wrong — genuinely looking for feedback. I'm 38 and in the past year, I've felt my body go through a list of changes"
> "I'm too scared to go to my doctor about it knowing that I'll likely be dismissed"
> "I kept telling myself 'nah, I'm too young for that'"

### Walk In With Evidence
**Target segment:** gp_frustrated | **Target emotion:** Empowerment after years of being dismissed
**Hook:** "You know something is wrong. Now you can prove it."
**App solution:** The GP Export gives you a clean, dated PDF summary of your symptoms after 14 days of tracking — something concrete to put in front of your doctor instead of trying to explain what you've been feeling for months.

Supporting quotes:
> "I had a six month symptom diary that showed consistently I was sane for two weeks and then all over the place for the second half of my cycle"
> "she straight up said 'have you considered anti-depressants or anti-anxiety meds for your moods etc?'"
> "I'm done being gaslit about this. I'm done being made to feel like my pain isn't real."

### Finally See the Pattern
**Target segment:** early_stage | **Target emotion:** Relief and clarity after months of confusion
**Hook:** "It's not random. It just looks that way until you start tracking."
**App solution:** Sulu's Timeline and Weekly Snapshot show you how your symptoms move together — hot flashes, mood, sleep, energy — so the pattern becomes visible without you having to do anything except a 30-second daily check-in.

Supporting quotes:
> "I did not realise that it was this many. FML."
> "Until I figured out I was in perimenopause, I just figured I was dying of some slow, shitty cancer of the reproductive system."

### 30 Seconds a Day, Not a Second Job
**Target segment:** tracker_fatigued | **Target emotion:** Relief from overwhelm
**Hook:** "You've tried the spreadsheets. You've tried the period apps. This is neither."
**App solution:** Sulu's Daily Check-In takes 30 seconds — three to seven symptoms, simple 0–3 sliders, and you're done. No categories to configure, no data entry, no wellness rabbit holes. Just your symptoms, tracked.

Supporting quotes:

> "Someone is going to make a LOT of money making a perimenopause/menopause app — c'mon someone!"

### Your Body Is Keeping Score
**Target segment:** established | **Target emotion:** Validation — finally being taken seriously, starting with yourself
**Hook:** "Eleven symptoms at once, and 'nothing is really helping.' It matters to know what's getting worse, what's getting better, and what changed."
**App solution:** Sulu's Weekly Snapshot compares this week to last week — with direction arrows showing which symptoms are improving, worsening, or stable. Change markers track HRT adjustments, stress, and other factors alongside your symptoms so the connection becomes clear.

Supporting quotes:
> "11 CURRENT — the number of symptoms that I've got right now and nothing is really helping"
> "I'm always trying to figure out what I did the day before that made my sleep better or worse"
> "the changes that happen when my doc tweaks my HRT"

### From Research to Prescription
**Target segment:** hrt_considering | **Target emotion:** Determined confidence — I've done my research, now I need to be heard
**Hook:** "You've read everything. Now bring something your GP can't argue with."
**App solution:** Track your symptoms for two weeks and export a clear PDF timeline for your appointment. Not a printout from the internet — your own data, showing your own pattern, in your doctor's language.

Supporting quotes:
> "I want to fix the cause and not treat just the symptoms"
> "I asked: what's the risk to starting estrogen now? What is your reluctance?"

Supporting quotes:
> "A symptom tracker so I can show my doctor"
> "I want to see and present evidence to my doctor"
> "What so many of us are seeing + reporting to our doctors, and then often not being believed, is straight-up medical gaslighting"

### The Pattern Moment
**Target segment:** universal | **Target emotion:** Relief
**Hook:** "For months it felt random. Then the pattern appeared."
**App solution:** Sulu's Weekly Snapshot and automatic Pattern Recognition show you what's actually correlating with your symptoms — alcohol, stress, sleep, medication changes — so the fog starts to lift.

Supporting quotes:
> "For months, they felt random. Then I started tracking them. Turns out, they hit almost exactly three hours after I fall asleep"
> "I feel like menopause is just a giant mystery we're left to solve on our own"
> "Its hard to tell what edges them on (perhaps alcohol??) or what is just continually happening"

### Built For This, Not Adapted For This
**Target segment:** tracker_fatigued | **Target emotion:** Frustration
**Hook:** "You've tried the period tracker. You've tried the wellness app. You've tried the notes app. None of them were built for this."
**App solution:** Sulu tracks only perimenopause symptoms — chosen by you from a curated list of nine — in a 30-second daily check-in. No fertility predictions. No wellness noise. No overwhelm.

Supporting quotes:
> "I'm in the middle of perimenopause hell. There are no apps that I find that help"

### HRT: Know If It's Working
**Target segment:** hrt_considering | **Target emotion:** Uncertainty
**Hook:** "Starting HRT is the beginning, not the end. The real question is: how do you know if it's actually working?"

Supporting quotes:
> "Get on hrt asap if you can - I was in the same boat as you, roughly the same age, found a sympathetic doctor"
> "Now that I'm on HRT I can tell a major difference"
> "I'm very confused about where to start with HRT"

### The Two-Year Learning Curve, Shortened
**Target segment:** established | **Target emotion:** Exhaustion
**Hook:** "Nobody should spend two years guessing which symptoms are from perimenopause and which are from everything else you've tried to fix it."

Supporting quotes:

### Years, Not Weeks
**Target segment:** early_stage | **Target emotion:** Grief and urgency
**Hook:** "Ten years. That's how long some women wait before anyone names what they're going through."
**App solution:** Sulu helps you start building a clear symptom record now — so when you do speak to a doctor, you're not starting from scratch.

Supporting quotes:
> "Ten years. No one ever told me the symptoms were peri related."

**App solution:** Log a change marker when you start or adjust HRT. Sulu tracks what shifts — and when — so your next appointment is a conversation about data, not memory.

### The 'Is This Perimenopause?' Angle

**Hook:** "Something has shifted. You're not imagining it — but you can't quite describe it yet."
**App solution:** Sulu helps you track nine perimenopause-specific symptoms from day one — so by the time you sit down with your GP, you have 14 days of data, not a vague feeling.

**Hook:** "You've started HRT. Now how do you know if it's working?"
**App solution:** Sulu's Change Markers let you log when you start or adjust HRT, then track how your symptoms shift over days and weeks — so your next appointment has data behind it, not just a feeling.

**Hook:** "Walk in with a clear timeline. Walk out with a plan."
**App solution:** After 14 days of tracking, Sulu generates a PDF summary of your symptoms — a clear, calm record you can hand your GP or take into any specialist appointment.

**Target segment:** gp_frustrated | **Target emotion:** vindication and anger
