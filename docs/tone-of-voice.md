## Why two voices?

Sulu has two distinct voices. They serve different purposes and must never be mixed.

**The ad voice** gets women through the door. It meets them where they are — frustrated, dismissed, exhausted, and looking for someone who gets it. It earns attention fast because it sounds like something a real woman would say at 11pm in a Facebook group.

**The app voice** keeps them there. Once a woman has downloaded Sulu and starts using it daily, she doesn't need to be sold to. She needs to feel that the app is calm, intelligent, and on her side without making a big deal of it. She's dealing with enough.

These are different jobs. The ad voice makes her download the app. The app voice makes her trust it.

> **The mistake to avoid:** Letting acquisition anger bleed into the daily experience. Rage and dismissal are powerful acquisition hooks. As daily check-in copy, they're exhausting. Protect the app voice.

## The Ad Voice

### What it does

Stops the scroll. Makes a woman who has spent three years being told she's "probably just stressed" feel seen in three seconds. Then earns the tap.

### Principles

**1. Lead with recognition, not information.**
The goal isn't to explain perimenopause. It's to make her feel understood before she even reads the second line.

**2. Shorter sentences. More line breaks.**
Ad copy breathes. Lots of white space. Urgency without breathlessness.

**3. Raw, not polished.**
The brand has an elegant visual identity. The ad voice can be rougher. It should sound like something she'd share with a friend, not something from a healthcare brand.

**4. Name the thing no one names.**
The strongest hooks are the ones that say what women have been told is unsayable — the rage, the brain fog at work, being sent home with antidepressants when they needed hormones.

**5. Don't diagnose. Do ask the question.**
"This is your hormones, not your mental health" is a diagnostic claim. "What if it's not just anxiety?" is an invitation. Soften claims to questions. The research is validating; the app is not prescribing.

**6. End with agency, not sympathy.**
Women aren't looking to be pitied. They're looking for something that will help them get taken seriously. The payoff should feel like power, not compassion.

### The 6 messaging pillars — ad voice

| Pillar | Hook | Who it's for |
|---|---|---|
| The Evidence | "Your doctor can't dismiss a timeline." | Women who feel dismissed by healthcare |
| The Pattern | "It's not random. It just looks that way until you start tracking." | Women at the beginning, confused |
| The Rage / Identity | "Nobody warned you about the rage. You're not broken." | Universal — strongest emotional hook |
| The HRT Question | "Starting HRT is one thing. Knowing if it's working — that's something else." | Women already on or considering HRT |
| The Simplicity | "30 seconds a day. Not a wellness routine." | Women burned out by tracking apps |
| Not Too Young | "38 is not too young. And your list of symptoms is not nothing." | Women dismissed due to age |

**On aspirational angles:** Every pillar currently leads with pain. At least 1–2 ads should show what happens *after* tracking — the moment it clicked, the appointment that felt different. Examples: *"After 14 days, something clicked. I could finally see what was happening."* / *"The first appointment where I wasn't explaining from scratch."*

### Good ad voice examples

> Nobody warned you about the rage.
> Not a bad mood. Not stress.
> Actual rage — at the traffic, at the question, at nothing.
> You're not broken. You might be in perimenopause.

---

> Walk in with evidence, not apologies.
> Sulu tracks your symptoms so you don't have to explain yourself from scratch.

---

> 38 is not too young.
> "Probably just anxiety" is not a diagnosis.
> Start tracking. See what's actually there.

---

> What if it's not just anxiety?
> Three months of daily tracking.
> One clear pattern.
> One different conversation with your doctor.

### What to avoid in ads

- **Sympathy language:** "We know how hard this is." Too soft. Women don't want sympathy from an app. They want tools.
- **Wellness-brand warmth:** "Your journey to feeling better starts here." Wrong register entirely.
- **Diagnostic claims:** "This is hormones, not anxiety." Soften to questions. Never state diagnoses.
- **"Prove it" language:** The report supports discussion. It doesn't prove anything. Use "show your doctor" not "prove to your doctor."
- **Vagueness:** "Track your symptoms and understand your body better." Says nothing. Be specific.

## The App Voice

### What it does

Supports a woman at her worst moments — 3am, exhausted, logging another terrible sleep — without making her feel like she's being managed, coached, or sold to.

### The 3am test

Every piece of in-app copy must pass this test:

> *Could a woman read this at 3am, unable to sleep, and not find it annoying, patronising, or cheerful?*

If it's too perky, it fails. If it's too clinical, it fails. If it's too much to process, it fails. The app voice is the thing that's still calm when she isn't.

### Principles

**1. Calm > clever.**
Wit is allowed. Wit that requires effort to parse is not. If it needs a second read, cut it.

**2. Describe, don't advise.**
The app records what happened. It does not tell her what to do next. Copy that implies a recommendation — even subtly — crosses a line the app must not cross.

**3. One idea per screen.**
Never compete for attention with dense copy. Every screen has one thing to say.

**4. Dry wit is fine. Cheerful is not.**
There's a difference between *"Saved."* (good) and *"Great job logging today! 🎉"* (never). The app can have personality. It should not perform positivity.

**5. Intelligent, not clinical.**
Use real language, not medical language. Not "vasomotor symptoms" — "hot flashes." Not "luteal phase dysphoric disorder" — "the week before your period." Women are intelligent. Clinical jargon isn't intelligent — it's distant.

**6. Never condescending, never cheerleading.**
She doesn't need the app to celebrate her for logging. She doesn't need the app to motivate her. Treat her like a capable adult.

**7. Specificity over generality.**
"A bit more tracking will make this summary more useful" — good. "Keep going!" — useless. If you can't say something specific, say less.

### Good app voice examples

**Empty state (early)**
> Not much to see yet.
> A few more check-ins will add context.

**After saving a check-in**
> Saved.

**Timeline — no patterns yet**
> There wasn't enough information this week to highlight patterns.
> That's okay. This builds over time.

**Under 14 days — report not yet available**
> [X] more days until your first report.
> Keep logging. The patterns become visible over time.

**After a hard week, report prompt**
> This was a difficult week. A report can help your doctor understand what you've been experiencing.

**Weekly snapshot — mixed week**
> Based on your check-ins, this was a mixed week — some things up, some down.

**Pattern insight**
> On days with a Stressful Day logged, sleep severity was higher than average.
> *(No conclusion. No advice. Just the pattern.)*

**Symptom description — Rage / irritability**
> Rage that feels out of proportion. And is completely real.

**Check-in prompt (notification)**
> How was today?

### What to avoid in-app

| Avoid | Instead |
|---|---|
| "Great job tracking today! 🎉" | "Saved." |
| "You're doing amazing." | Nothing. |
| "Your body is telling you something!" | — |
| "Keep going — you've got this." | "This builds over time." |
| "We know perimenopause can be tough." | — |
| "It's important to speak to a medical professional." | "If anything feels worrying, your doctor is the right place to start." |
| Any emoji in core UX (outside onboarding) | — |
| "Vasomotor symptoms" | "Hot flashes" |
| "Luteal phase" | "The week before your period" |
| "Clinical insights" | "Patterns" |

## Side by side — same idea, two voices

**Idea: The report helps at appointments.**

| Ad voice | App voice |
|---|---|
| "Walk in with evidence, not apologies." | "A report can help your doctor understand what you've been experiencing." |
| "Your doctor can't dismiss a timeline." | "Export your symptom summary for your next appointment." |

---

**Idea: Not enough data yet.**

| Ad voice | App voice |
|---|---|
| "38 is not too young. Start tracking." | "A few more check-ins will add context." |
| (Not applicable — ads don't show empty states) | "Not quite yet. A bit more tracking will make this summary more useful." |

---

**Idea: Patterns becoming visible.**

| Ad voice | App voice |
|---|---|
| "It's not random. It just looks that way until you start tracking." | "Based on your check-ins, this week felt a bit more intense than last week." |
| "After 14 days, something clicked." | "On days with a Stressful Day logged, sleep was higher than average." |

## What "elegant, calm, lightly funny" actually means

The product design doc describes the voice as "elegant, calm, lightly funny / non-medical, non-technical." Here's what that means in practice:

**Elegant:** Not sparse for the sake of sparse. Copy earns its place. No filler, no throat-clearing, no marketing language. Elegant is confident enough not to over-explain.

**Calm:** The app is the steady thing when everything else isn't. It doesn't spike with urgency, excitement, or alarm. Even difficult content (a hard week, a strong pattern) is delivered without drama.

**Lightly funny:** Dry. Occasional. Never at the user's expense. Never forced. It's the difference between *"Saved."* and nothing, where "Saved." has the slightest hint of personality because of its brevity. Don't write jokes. Let the restraint be the wit.
